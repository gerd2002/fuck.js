# Fuck.js

A library that censors out all swear words. The list used can be found [here](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words). It was modified (all list combined into one big js array).

Usage: 
```js
const fuck = require('fuck.js')

fuck.clean('shut up you fuck') // returns 'shut up you BLEEEEEP'
```
